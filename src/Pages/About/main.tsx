                    <h2>Hello, let me introduce myself.</h2>
                    <p>I am an aspiring programmer with a strong passion for learning and problem-solving. After years of self-study, I have acquired formal education
                    to further enhance my skills. I am proficient in JavaScript and C and have experience with Java and Python. Additionally, I am comfortable working
                    with both Windows and multiple Linux systems. Currently, I am studying at Hive Helsinki coding school, continuously pushing myself to grow as a developer.
                    I thrive on challenges and enjoy tackling complex problems in programming.
                    On this website, you can find more about my education, experience, portfolio, and a few small demos showcasing my work.</p>
