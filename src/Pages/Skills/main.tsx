                            I can handle not only Windows but also other operating systems, <br />
                            and learning new programs or solving computer problems has not yet become an obstacle.<br />
                            My programming experience is focused on JavaScript. Along with that, HTML, CSS and React have become familiar and <br />
                            I've been able to  experiment with other languages, such as C++ , Python and Java.<br />
                            I am motivated to deepen my knowledge in these languages, as well as to develop new skills according to the opportunities that come up, <br />
                            both for work and on my own initiative in my free time.<br />
                            Recently, I have also acquired a more formal education through the Open University. For example, in the Capstone project,<br />
                            we created a ready-made tool to fully meet the customer's needs from start to finish.<br />
                            During the project, I learned to work as part of a big team and to communicate my ideas and opinions. <br />
                            I also got hands-on experience with React and Java Spring.<br />
